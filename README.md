A clicker game for the Telegram Web Apps platform and the TON blockchain (in the future). Inspired by legendary [@notcoin_bot](https://t.me/notcoin_bot) . Click on Posha, buy crazy boosters, use the help of the SEC and knock out your legitimate (not) money!



The project is written in JavaScript (frontend) and my favorite Golang (backend). The game engine was written using the https://pixijs.com/ framework. Simple and reliable like a Swiss army knife :) 



## Features

- Very simple code - minimal dependencies

- Super fast backend thanks to  ‚ù§Ô∏è Golang ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Cross-platform thanks to ‚ù§Ô∏è Telegram Web Apps ‚ù§Ô∏è



The game can be launched in a browser, but it was originally designed for Telegram Web Apps. You can try the demo version here [@durka_game_bot](https://t.me/durka_game_bot)



 ***ATTENTION***! The game is being improved and finalized! The authors do not take any responsibility for the functionality of the demo version. Alexey ([JinnySh23](https://github.com/JinnySh23)) has the superpower to break a database with just a glance :) **If you are unable to launch it, please contact [@agavacrypto](https://t.me/agavacrypto) team.**



The project was created based on the idea and order of the AGAVA CRYPTO Team([@agavacrypto](https://t.me/agavacrypto)). **For all questions and complaints, please contact these crazy guys**  *Guys, I really love your team, thanks to you we have lots of beer! :)*
